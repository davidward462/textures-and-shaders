# textures-and-shaders
Animation in WebGL using some custom textures and shaders. Written as a graphics course project. 

## Marking scheme and notes

1. Hierarchical object: Butterfly with body and wings. Gnome with body -> head -> eyes -> pupils, also head -> hat.

2. Two textures: Ground has a procedurally generated grass texture, and mushrooms have a custom texure for the top.

3. Convert the ADS shader from a vertex to fragment: Complete. Lighting is now done in the fragment shader, along with textures.

4. Convert the Phong to Blinn-Phong in the new fragment shader: conversion was done, also textures get lighting also. 

5. At least one shader edited or designed from scratch: Not complete.

6. 360 degree camera fly around: Camera rotates around the viewing area.

7. Scene runs in real-time: yes.

8. display frame rate: not complete.

9. Complexity: Circle of mushrooms with a butterfly overhear, gnome with a hierarchy of body parts.

10. Creativity: I think it's pretty interesting and whimsical. 

11. Quality: Object line up, gnome jumps without glitching, etc.

12. Programming style: Functions and comments used where appropriate. 

13. Submit a movie of the animation: yes

14. Provide a readme.txt: The README file exists.
